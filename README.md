# Tic Tac Toe and the Minimax AI

#### Project Contributors: Quang Nguyen, Andrew Nguyen

## Project Description
This game is a Java version of the Tic Tac Toe game. This game has:
- A Simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game board
- A Big Caro game board with easy to configure board size
- A MiniMax AI playing in the command prompt.

## Manual
- Run `BigTTT.java` to play a Caro game. The board size is big and you have to get 5 consecutive marks to win
- Run `TTT.java` to play the a simple Tic Tac Toe game. 
- Run `TTTwithAI.java` to play a simple Tic Tac Toe game against an AI in the command prompt.*

*The `BigTTT.java` is not too sensitive so player may need to be patient to click on the next move. In addition, there are some bugs for the top row. To select a cell, click the bottom left of the cell to execute. 
*This AI is unbeatable and to change who goes first, go to `TTTwithAI.java` and change the variable `isHumanPlayerX` to `true/ false`
